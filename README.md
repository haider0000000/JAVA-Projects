# ATM INTERFACE
This project is an ATM simulation program written in Java. It allows users to perform basic banking operations such as withdrawing money, depositing money, transferring funds, and checking the last transaction. The program prompts the user for their PIN and presents a menu with options to choose from. The user can continue performing transactions until they choose to quit. The code keeps track of the number of withdrawals, deposits, and transfers made, and it displays the relevant information accordingly. It provides a simple and interactive way to simulate ATM operations.

# NUMBER_GUESSING_GAME
The "NumberGuessingGame" is a Java program that implements a simple number-guessing game. The program generates a random number between 1 and 100, and the player has 8 trials to guess the correct number. It uses the Scanner class to read the user's input from the console.

The game prompts the player to enter their guess, and based on their input, it provides feedback on whether the actual number is greater or less than the guess. If the player guesses the number correctly, a congratulatory message is displayed, and the game ends. If the player exhausts all the trials without guessing the number correctly, the program reveals the correct number.
